# Sample Organization Community Template
Welcome to the Sample Organization community! In this repository you will find documentation, resources, wins, and more. It is a place to track organization initiatives, ask questions, outline and define policies, and build culture.

## Our Mission
(List the mission here)

## Our Core Values
Core values guide how we make decisions. And they attempt to help hold us accountable to one another.
- Sample value #1
- (Example value:) Whenever possible, start with open communication in Slack.

## Table of Contents:

### Issues:
We can use issues to categorize things? Maybe track ongoing work?

### Projects:
Projects combine issues?

### Wiki:
In depth documentation?

### Discussions:
We use discussions as a way to ask questions, get feedback, flag problems, and foster transparent collaboration. Anyone can open a discussion about any topic. 

For example, let's say you think that guidance around a particular policy is confusing. You might post that in Slack and our team might have a conversation about it. As we resolve that in Slack, we might create a discussion post to add clarity around this.
